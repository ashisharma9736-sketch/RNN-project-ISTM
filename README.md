Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are deep learning models designed for sequential data. They retain past inputs through hidden states, enabling tasks like language modeling, speech recognition, and time-series forecasting. Variants such as LSTM and GRU solve issues like vanishing gradients, making RNNs effective for temporal patterns.
