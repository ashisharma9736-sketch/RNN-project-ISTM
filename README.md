# RNN-project-ISTM
Explore various Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures—including LSTM and GRU—through practical Jupyter Notebook examples. This project demonstrates how RNNs process sequential data and learn temporal dependencies, with hands-on experiments in language modeling, speech recognition, and time series forecasting. Designed for students and researchers, the notebooks highlight key deep learning concepts, tackle challenges like vanishing gradients, and provide insights into effectively modeling temporal patterns.
